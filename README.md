# module2-solution
This project is a responsive webpage built as part of Module 2â€™s assignment. The goal is to create a single-page layout that adjusts its design based on the screen size (desktop, tablet, and mobile). The page includes a heading and three sections (Chicken, Beef, and Sushi), styled without using external CSS frameworks.
